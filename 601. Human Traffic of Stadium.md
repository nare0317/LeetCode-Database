# 601. Human Traffic of Stadium
## Description


Table: Stadium
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| visit_date    | date    |
| people        | int     |
+---------------+---------+
visit_date is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the visit date and visit id to the stadium with the number of people during the visit.
No two rows will have the same visit_date, and as the id increases, the dates increase as well.
``` 

Write an SQL query to display the records with three or more rows with consecutive id's, and the number of people is greater than or equal to 100 for each.

Return the result table ordered by visit_date in ascending order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: 
Stadium table:
+------+------------+-----------+
| id   | visit_date | people    |
+------+------------+-----------+
| 1    | 2017-01-01 | 10        |
| 2    | 2017-01-02 | 109       |
| 3    | 2017-01-03 | 150       |
| 4    | 2017-01-04 | 99        |
| 5    | 2017-01-05 | 145       |
| 6    | 2017-01-06 | 1455      |
| 7    | 2017-01-07 | 199       |
| 8    | 2017-01-09 | 188       |
+------+------------+-----------+
Output: 
+------+------------+-----------+
| id   | visit_date | people    |
+------+------------+-----------+
| 5    | 2017-01-05 | 145       |
| 6    | 2017-01-06 | 1455      |
| 7    | 2017-01-07 | 199       |
| 8    | 2017-01-09 | 188       |
+------+------------+-----------+
Explanation: 
The four rows with ids 5, 6, 7, and 8 have consecutive ids and each of them has >= 100 people attended. Note that row 8 was included even though the visit_date was not the next day after row 7.
The rows with ids 2 and 3 are not included because we need at least three consecutive ids.
```

## My Answer 

```SQL
-- MS SQL Server 
SELECT A.id, A.visit_date, A.people
  FROM (SELECT id, visit_date, people, 
                LEAD(people,1) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS next_1, 
                LEAD(people,2) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS next_2,
                LAG(people,1) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS prev_1, 
                LAG(people,2) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS prev_2
         FROM Stadium ) AS A
 WHERE (A.people >=100 AND A.next_1 >=100 AND A.next_2 >=100)
    OR (A.people >=100 AND A.prev_1 >=100 AND A.prev_2 >=100)
    OR (A.people >=100 AND A.prev_1 >=100 AND A.next_1 >=100)
 ORDER BY A.visit_date
```

## Other Solutions 

```SQL
-- MySql
WITH diff_group AS (
    SELECT id
            ,visit_date
            ,people
            ,id - row_number() OVER(ORDER BY id) AS diff
    FROM Stadium
    WHERE people >= 100
)
SELECT id
        ,visit_date
        ,people 
FROM diff_group
WHERE diff IN 
            (SELECT diff
            FROM diff_group 
            GROUP BY diff
            HAVING count(id) >= 3)
;


-- MySql
with t as ( select t1.id , t1.visit_date , t1.people , 
            id - row_number() OVER(ORDER BY id) as grp
       from stadium t1
       where people >= 100 
          )
select t.id, t.visit_date ,t.people
from t 
where grp in ( select grp from t group by grp having count(*) >=3  )
```
