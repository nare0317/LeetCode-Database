A company's executives are interested in seeing who earns the most money in each of the company's departments. A **high earner** in a department is an employee who has a salary in the **top three unique** salaries for that department.

Write an SQL query to find the employees who are **high earners** in each of the departments.

Return the result table **in any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 
Employee table:
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| id | name  | salary | departmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 85000  | 1            |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
| 5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            |
| 6  | Randy | 85000  | 1            |
| 7  | Will  | 70000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
Department table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | IT    |
| 2  | Sales |
+----+-------+
Output: 
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 85000  |
| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
| IT         | Will     | 70000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
Explanation: 
In the IT department:
- Max earns the highest unique salary
- Both Randy and Joe earn the second-highest unique salary
- Will earns the third-highest unique salary

In the Sales department:
- Henry earns the highest salary
- Sam earns the second-highest salary
- There is no third-highest salary as there are only two employees
```

## My Answer 

```SQL
-- MS SQL Server 
SELECT B.name AS Department, A.name AS Employee, A.salary AS Salary
  FROM (
            SELECT id, name, salary, departmentId, 
                   DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY departmentId ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank  -- 
              FROM Employee 
        ) AS A 
  JOIN Department AS B ON A.departmentId = B.id
 WHERE A.rank <= 3
```

## Other Solutions 

```SQL
-- MySql
SELECT d. name as Department, a.name as Employee, A.salary from
(SELECT name,departmentId, salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY departmentId order by salary desc) rnk from Employee) A
INNER JOIN
Department d
ON
A.departmentId = d.id
WHERE A.rnk < 4
```

### DENSE_RANK() function 

>The DENSE_RANK() is a window function that assigns a rank to each row within a partition of a result set. Unlike the RANK() function, the DENSE_RANK() function >returns consecutive rank values. Rows in each partition receive the same ranks if they have the same values.

>The syntax of the DENSE_RANK() function is as follows:

```
DENSE_RANK() OVER (
    [PARTITION BY partition_expression, ... ]
    ORDER BY sort_expression [ASC | DESC], ...
)
```

### RANK, DENSE_RANK, ROW_NUMBER 차이 

  1. **RANK** : 중복 값에 대해서 **동일한 순위** 그리고 중복 값 다음 값에 대해서 **중복순위 + 중복값 개수** 의 순위를 출력합니다.

  2. **DENSE_RANK** : 중복 값에 대해서 **동일한 순위** 그리고 중복 값 다음 값에 대해서 **중복순위 + 1** 의 순위를 출력합니다.

  3. **ROW_NUMBER** : 중복 값에 대해서 **순차적인 순위** 그리고 중복 값 다음 값에 대해서 또한 순차적인 순위를 출력합니다.
