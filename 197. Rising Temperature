##### Description

Table: `Weather`

```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| Id            | int     |
| RecordDate    | date    |
| Temperature   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
Id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.

```

Write an SQL query to find all dates' `Id` with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
Weather table:
+----+------------+-------------+
| Id | RecordDate | Temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
+----+------------+-------------+
Output:
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 4  |
+----+
Explanation:
In 2015-01-02, the temperature was higher than the previous day (10 -> 25).
In 2015-01-04, the temperature was higher than the previous day (20 -> 30).
```



#### My Answer 

```SQL
SELECT A.Id
FROM	(SELECT Id, RecordDate, Temperature,
				LAG(Temperature,1,NULL) OVER(ORDER BY RecordDate) AS PrevTemperature,
				LAG(RecordDate,1,NULL) OVER(ORDER BY RecordDate) AS Yesterday
	  FROM Weather
		) AS A
WHERE A.Temperature - A.PrevTemperature > 0 AND DATEADD(DD,-1,RecordDate) = Yesterday
```
